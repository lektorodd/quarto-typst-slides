# Introduction

This content appears in both slides and documents.

::: {.slides-only}
- Bullet points for slides
- Keep it concise
- Visual focus
:::

::: {.doc-only}
This is a detailed explanation that only appears in the document version.
It provides additional context, references, and in-depth analysis that
would be too verbose for slides but is essential for the written document.

You can include longer paragraphs, detailed explanations, and comprehensive
discussions here without worrying about cluttering your presentation.

# Main Content

## Key Points

Here's some content that appears in both formats:

- Point 1: Universal content
- Point 2: Works everywhere
- Point 3: Shared information

::: {.slides-only}
**Remember**: Focus on visuals during presentation!
:::

::: {.doc-only}
**Note**: The document version can include additional references, footnotes,
and detailed explanations. For instance, you might want to cite sources here
(Smith et al., 2024) or provide mathematical derivations that would be too
complex for a slide presentation.
:::

## Code Example

Here's some code that appears in both:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

::: {.doc-only}
### Detailed Code Explanation

In the document version, we can provide a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function `hello_world()` takes no parameters
2. It prints a greeting message to stdout
3. It returns a boolean value `True` to indicate success

This level of detail is appropriate for documentation but would be excessive
for a presentation slide.

# Results

## Findings

::: {.slides-only}
**Key Result**: 95% success rate!

_Quick takeaway for slides_
:::

::: {.doc-only}
### Detailed Analysis of Results

Our comprehensive study revealed a 95% success rate across all experimental
conditions. This section provides detailed statistical analysis, methodology
notes, and discusses potential confounding variables.

**Table 1**: Detailed results by condition

| Condition | Success Rate | N | p-value |
|-----------|-------------|---|---------|
| A | 93% | 100 | < 0.001 |
| B | 97% | 100 | < 0.001 |
| C | 95% | 100 | < 0.001 |

These results suggest strong evidence for our hypothesis, with all conditions
showing statistically significant improvements over baseline.

## Concluding Remarks

This document has presented a comprehensive analysis of the topic. We have
demonstrated the utility of conditional content in creating both presentation
slides and detailed documentation from a single source file.

### Future Work

Future research should investigate:

1. Extended applications of this approach
2. Integration with other documentation systems
3. Automated content transformation pipelines

We thank all contributors and reviewers for their valuable feedback and
suggestions that improved this work.
